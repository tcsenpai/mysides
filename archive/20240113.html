The Houthis, who are part of the Zaydi Shia movement, have been fighting against the Yemeni government and its allies, including the Gulf Cooperation Council and coalition forces led by Saudi Arabia. The article notes that the Houthis have previously carried out drone and missile attacks against Saudi Arabia, including attacks on Abha International Airport and the Aramco oil facility in Jeddah. The article also mentions that the US has recently carried out airstrikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which is a terrorist organization operating in Yemen. The article suggests that the US may take further military action against the Houthis in the future. However, the article also notes that the US has been working on a political solution to the conflict in Yemen, which involves negotiations between the Yemeni government and the Houthis.</p><a href='https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-biden-retaliation-attacks-0804b93372cd5e874a0dd03513fe36a2'>Read the full article</a><hr><h1>Israel defends itself at the UN’s top court against allegations of genocide in Gaza</h1><p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has rejected South Africa's request to verify if Israel's actions in Gaza in 2014 constituted genocide.

The ICJ also ruled that the case was not part of a broader humanitarian review of Israeli actions against Palestine.

The study suggests that the region is set to experience more frequent and severe heat waves in the coming years. The researchers used a novel statistical model to show that the hot weather in the region is powered by a combination of long-term climate change and a sudden surge in ocean heat known as an el Niño event.

The European Union is currently in the final stages of negotiations for its post-COVID recovery and budget package, which is expected to be worth €1.8 trillion and include spending on a variety of sectors, including healthcare and infrastructure. The package is also expected to address climate change and digitization. The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, meanwhile, has left the European budget in a vulnerable position, with some member states pushing for a smaller budget to ensure contribution stability. This has sparked concern among some that Brussels might struggle to meet its spending commitments. However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen remains confident that the package will be accepted by European members and pushed through.</p><a href='https://euobserver.com/eu-elections/157883?utm_source=euobs&utm_medium=rss'>Read the full article</a><hr><h1>EU hopes for youth surge in June, asks Taylor Swift for help</h1><p>The article discusses the European Union's proposal for a new European Health Union, which aims to improve the EU's response to health crises and emergencies.

The investigation comes after a complaint was filed by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, which argued that the billboards violate EU law. The billboards, which feature images of a man and a woman with the caption "Let's not let ourselves be fooled, let's not let our children be mixed up," are part of a broader campaign against "homosexual propaganda." Hungary's government denies that the billboards are anti-LGBTQ, but rather a response to what it calls "ideological harassment" from groups that promote gender identity over biological sex. The investigation is significant because it is the first time the EU has launched such an investigation into a member state for anti-LGBTQ measures.

The EU has had mixed results in leading a coordinated response to the pandemic, with Member States struggling to control the spread of the virus and to produce sufficient test kits, personal protective equipment, and vaccines. The Cold War mentality has also not aided the EU's response, as seen in the approval of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine by the EMA, with internal EU disagreement over whether or not to approve or distribute it. The article also highlights problems with the EU's vaccine roll-out, including "OxfordGate" over the mistaken governance and purchasing by Oxford/AZ, leading to vaccine rationing, that EU can't commandeer excess production from Oxford/AZ for more than 130M doses, and that it's not just vaccine roll-out, it's a domestic BIA and trade policy process.

The proposal includes a set of integrated reforms to speed up and simplify the asylum process, enhance the effectiveness of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), and tighten the LAA Standard (Prevention of Foreseeable Illegal Migration). The EC believes the reform package will better protect the rights of those seeking protection, while also ensuring a more efficient assessment of applications and swift returns for those whose asylum requests do not meet the criteria for international protection. The reform package includes changes to the rules on "safe third countries," a proposal for a European Union Agency to manage applications for international protection, and a new basis for returns to replace the "Dublin III" system. The proposal contains measures aiming to strike a balance between speeding up the asylum process, ensuring the rights of asylum-seekers, and preventing abuse of the asylum system. Restrictions on entry to the EU would be based on a "way of life" being regarded as in breach of a norm worldwide or in the region to which the person wishes to seek asylum. The proposed EU Agency for Borders and Coasts will have a dual role as manager of the European Union Solidarity Bonds in apportioning and distribution of IRB to ailing Member States.
The reform package also includes changes to legal oversight of immigration detention, the need for "a clear clause to ensure that any detention is not arbitrary," the need for a right of appeal free of any procedural obstacle, and the adoption of a non-permanent mandate for the board of Appeal to be created. The EC will continue to provide guidance and support to member states on the content of the rules and the extent to which decisions on matters of project implementation and allocation of resources to Member States are the responsibility of the Commission.

The EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said that the regulation would require companies to ensure that all packaging materials can be easily recycled or recycled into other products. The plan is to cut the amount of packaging used in the EU by 50% by 2030 and to reduce the amount of packaging waste from foodstuffs by 30% by 2030. The EU will scrutinize the recycling track record of the packaging industry in terms of the amount of waste generated compared to the amount of material used. The majority of the packaging used in the food and beverage industry is made of plastic, and the use of single-use plastics that are difficult to recycle has become a major environmental concern across Europe. The regulation could also require a minimum volume of recycled materials in new packaging and set specific environmental criteria for packaging design so they can be easily recycled. The new regulation will also increase the amount of money companies pay to use virgin materials by taxing them, which should provide an economic incentive to use more recycled materials. The EU has already issued a circular economy action plan and a plastics strategy in 2018, but the new regulation is a step forward for the Union. The regulation will also set up a clearer reference point for recycling targets that will replace the current mix of national and international standards.</p><a href='https://euobserver.com/green-economy/157852?utm_source=euobs&utm_medium=rss'>Read the full article</a><hr><h1>[Magazine] Prescribing a way out: EU's fight against antimicrobial resistance</h1><p>The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the European Union's (EU) healthcare system and how it has led to a new realization of the need for long-term investment in healthcare infrastructure and resources.
