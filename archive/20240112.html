The airstrikes were reportedly carried out using unmanned drones and targeted alleged plotters of the 2012 attack on a U.S. embassy in Yemen.
The article mentions that while the Biden administration has been focused on trying to end the war in Yemen, the drone strikes could potentially escalate the conflict. Democrats are concerned that the strikes may also undermine their efforts to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which has been used to justify military actions in the Middle East.

The article also notes that the Biden administration has faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over its handling of the war in Yemen. Some Republicans have called for a more forceful approach, while some Democrats have called for a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region.

Overall, the article highlights the tension between the Biden administration's goals of ending the war in Yemen and maintaining national security interests, as well as the ongoing challenges of navigating foreign policy in a divided Congress.</p><a href='https://www.allsides.com/news/2024-01-12-1104/foreign-policy-dems-angry-biden-over-yemen-airstrikes'>Read the full article</a><hr><h1>Feds say Texas is blocking Border Patrol from a section of the border, ask U.S. Supreme Court to intervene</h1><h2>The Texas Tribune</h2><h3></h3><p>According to AllSides News, on January 12, 2024, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials claimed that the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is blocking a section of the U.S. border and has asked the Supreme Court to intervene.
