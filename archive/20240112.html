The Biden administration responded with a series of retaliatory strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The attacks were carried out by the US military and involved several drones and missiles. The US government claimed that the strikes were aimed at the Houthi rebels' capabilities to carry out further attacks. The Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran, have frequently targeted US forces in the region, including an attack on a US military base in Mosul, Iraq, in January 2021. The Biden administration's decision to strike back at the Houthi rebels came after a series of escalating attacks in the region, including a strike on a US base in the Middle East in July. The US government has said that it remains committed to securing its troops in the region and will continue to take necessary measures to protect them. The Houthi rebels have not yet responded to the US strikes.</p><a href='https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-biden-retaliation-attacks-0804b93372cd5e874a0dd03513fe36a2'>Read the full article</a><hr><h1>Israel defends itself at the UN’s top court against allegations of genocide in Gaza</h1><p>The World Court has ruled that Israel's policies towards the Gaza Strip constitute genocide.
