# MySides

 Your reliable, unbiased news scraper. 

## The Archive

I maintain a daily updated (if I use this software) archive section. This is made by just running the software daily and uploading the archive folder.

## Disclaimer

MySides is a personal tool designed to scrape news from AllSides. Please note that all material downloaded, used, and reworked by this software is the property of AllSides. This tool aims to provide a quick overview of daily news. For more information, please refer to the AllSides Terms of Service.


## TLDR

MySides scrapes the latest news from AllSides and uses Perplexity AI APIs to summarize them into a concise, single-page format.

## Perplexity AI?

In my experience, Perplexity AI offers more competitive API pricing than OpenAI. If you're a premium user, you'll receive $5 per month in API credits, which is more than sufficient to run this program daily.
