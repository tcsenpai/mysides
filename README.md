## TLDR

MySides scrape AllSides for the latest news and uses Perplexity AI APIs to summarize them in a nice, single page.

## Perplexity AI?

Personally, I find their API pricing way better than OpenAI ones. If you are a premium user, you get also 5$ per month of credits for the APIs which is more than enough to run this program daily.
