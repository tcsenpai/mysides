# MySides

 Your reliable, unbiased news scraper. 

## The Archive

I maintain a daily updated (if I use this software) archive section. This is made by just running the software daily and uploading the archive folder.

## Disclaimer

MySides is a personal tool designed to scrape news from various sources. Please note that all material downloaded, used, and reworked by this software is the property of various sources. This tool aims to provide a quick overview of daily news. For more information, please refer to the various sources Terms of Service.

## Built-in sites

[x] APNews (world news)
[x] EuObserver (rss feed)

## Work In Progress

MySides is currently being extended to support multiple sites.
Stay tuned.

## TLDR

MySides scrapes the latest news from various sources and uses Perplexity AI APIs to summarize them into a concise, single-page format.

## Perplexity AI?

In my experience, Perplexity AI offers more competitive API pricing than OpenAI. If you're a premium user, you'll receive $5 per month in API credits, which is more than sufficient to run this program daily.
